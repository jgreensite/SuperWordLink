## SuperWordLink

I enjoy turn based card games and couchplay video games. I also wanted to learn how to build a game in Unity. Combining the two I have created SuperWordLink. It's been developed purely for fun.

# To Build

Grab the entire repository , fire up Unity 5 and select File => Run & Build. Note that I've updated a multiplayer script that I found at https://www.appsfresh.com/blog/multiplayer/ so that you can run several clients on one machine (very useful for testing). There seems to be a unity bug where you need to go to the help menu then go to File => Run multiplayer in order to run more than one client.

# Thanks

The unity and blender community are incredibly generous with their time and patience and I've read way too many tutorials and watched too many videos to be able to list out all the influences; however, special thanks go out to
