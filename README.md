## SuperWordLink

I enjoy turn based card games and couchplay video games. I also wanted to learn how to build a game in Unity. Combining the two I have created SuperWordLink. It's been developed purely for fun.

# To Build

Grab the entire repository , fire up Unity 5 and select File => Run & Build. Note that I've updated a multiplayer script that I found at https://www.appsfresh.com/blog/multiplayer/ so that you can run several clients on one machine (very useful for testing). There seems to be a unity bug where you need to go to the help menu then go to File => Run multiplayer in order to run more than one client.
